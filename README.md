# Instructions:

Your task is to write a very simple product catalogue app.

Write a simple REST API in whatever language you're most comfortable (NodeJS, Rails, Java...) that...
Has 1 endpoint /phones
Returns the attached "phones.json" payload (or a free version of it)
The data can all be mocked, no need for a persistence layer
Write a React app that displays the phones from the API
Use redux for state management and Axios (or similar library) for fetching data from the API
Display an initial list with all phones
When a phone model is selected from the list, it will render a phone detail view displaying a few more details about that phone
Display a spinner or placeholder component while the API request is ongoing
Make it look decent. No need for super sophisticated design, but at a minimum, make it somewhat responsive so that it doesn’t look terrible on a mobile phone. Add images for each device.
Push the code to a public github repo with a README.md that explains how to run API & Frontend app
Bonus points
Dockerize the app.
Write realistic unit/end-to-end tests.
